This is a pairs trading code assessment that came from a trading prop. shop.
You can find the flow of the questions and the answers in the jupyter notebook file in this folder.
------------------------------------
We have supplied you with a small dataset of 1 day price data of two stocks i.e. Instrument A and Instrument B.

The goal of this assignment is to work towards a trading model. Explain your findings, thoughts or hypothesis in a clear fashion.

This assignment comprises several steps:

1 - Data Preprocessing

2 - Analysis

3 - Trading model

Some steps can be solved/approached differently. Therefore, whenever suited, explain the reasoning behind your approach.

You can use any external library you want, but we expect to be able to just run your notebook top to bottom on Anaconda.
